Overview
========

**OCS2** is a C++ toolbox tailored for **O**\ ptimal **C**\ ontrol 
for **S**\ witched **S**\ ystems (OCS2). The toolbox provides an 
efficient implementation of the following algorithms:

* **SLQ**\: Continuous-time domin DDP
* **iLQR**\: Discrete-time domain DDP
* **SQP**\: Multiple-shooting algorithm based on `HPIPM <href="https://github.com/giaf/hpipm"/>`__
* **PISOC**\: Path integral stochatic optimal control

OCS2 handles general path constraints through Augmented Lagrangian or 
relaxed barrier methods. To facilitate the application of OCS2 in robotic 
tasks, it provides the user with additional tools to set up the system 
dynamics (such as kinematic or dynamic models) and cost/constraints 
(such as self-collision avoidance and end-effector tracking) from a URDF 
model. The library also provides an automatic differentiation tool to 
calculate derivatives of the system dynamics, constraints, and cost. To 
facilitate its deployment on robotic platforms, the OCS2 provides tools 
for ROS interfaces. The toolboxâ€™s efficient and numerically stable 
implementations in conjunction with its user-friendly interface have 
paved the way for employing it on numerous robotic applications with 
limited onboard computation power.
